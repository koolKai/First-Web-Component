What are Web Components?
-Set of web plateform API's that allow us to create, read, update, delete HTML Tags.
-Web Components do not use any special 3rd party liberary or frame work but can certainly be used with them.

It consists of three main technologies:

HTML templates : The "template" and "slot"
elements enable you to write markup templates that are not displayed on the rendered page. These can then be reused multiple times as the basis of a custom element's structure.

Custom elements : A set of JavaScript APIs that allow you to define custom elements and their behavior, which can then be used as desired in your user interface.

Shadow DOM : A set of JavaScript APIs for attaching an encapsulated "shadow" DOM tree to an element — which is rendered separately from the main document DOM — and controlling associated functionality.

There are some terminologies related to shadow DOM :

Shadow host: The regular DOM node that the shadow DOM is attached to.
Shadow tree: The DOM tree inside the shadow DOM.
Shadow boundary: the place where the shadow DOM ends, and the regular DOM begins.
Shadow root: The root node of the shadow tree.
